Todo Api .NET Assessment

This is a simple Todo API that allows you to create, read, update and delete todos. It is built using .NET 8 and 
Entity Framework Core.

For simplicity, the API uses an in-memory database.

## Assessment Requirements

Currently, only the `GET` method is implemented. The goal of the assessment is to implement the remaining methods:
- `POST` to create a new todo
- `PUT` to update an existing todo
- `DELETE` to delete an existing todo

Bonus:
- Add a feature to filter todos by `IsComplete` status
- Add a description field
- Add a due date and order the todos by due date
